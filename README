Weather App README

This is a sample app to show my coding style. 
This is a weather app that queries OpenWeatherMap API: http://openweathermap.org/api
It allows users to query the weather by city, zip, or GPS location and displays the last location when restarting the app.

To test it out yourself, make sure to replace the appId string in the WeatherSyncAdapter class with your own appId.
