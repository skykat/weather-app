Weather App README

This is a sample weather app to show my coding style. It uses OpenWeatherMap API: http://openweathermap.org/api and allows users to query the weather by city, zip, or GPS location. It displays the last location when restarting the app.

To test it out yourself, make sure to replace the appId string in the WeatherSyncAdapter class with your own appId.
